  "merit-based-triage": "The decision maker prioritizes patients based on merit, experience, rank, and past contributions rather than solely on medical need, survival probability, or equality. When faced with triage decisions, merit-focused reasoning weighs factors like a soldier's service record, leadership value, or skills over purely clinical indicators."
